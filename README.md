# Lab 8 The Ride-Hailing Service Part 1


1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

   Implemented all required features with BEM structure and naming conventions.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab.

   None.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab.

   1 hour. 30 minutes for styling since I don't see it in the next lab.

4. Show the impact of performance enhancements.

  Provide a comparison of the performance of page with vs without optimizations.
  At bare minimum, provide load times and file sizes.



  Very interestingly, the number of requests and file sizes are dependent on
  the window size. To have a controlled environment, I have fixed the window size
  at 1920 x 1080, the most common screen size for desktops.
  Before 92 requests, 2.2 MB transferred, 2.9 MB resources, Finish: 805 ms
